# Readme File for Peakers Geocoding Challenge

Dear Hiring Team @ Peakers,

Thank you for considering me as a candidate and for providing this fun challenge for me to test some of my technical skills.

For this project, I will use an ExpressJS server to create the front and back-end for a geocoding and distance tracking project.

I will use Angular on the front-end.
